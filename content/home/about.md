My name is Zuozhu Liu, I was born in 1994 in China. I received my Bachelor's degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in June 2015. During my undergraduate, I visited University of Notre Dame and University of Michigan, Ann arbor for three months in 2014.

Since September 2015, I became a Ph.D. candidate at Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](www.sutd.edu.sg)) under the guidance of [Prof. Tony Q.S. Quek](http://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/) and [Prof. Lin Shaowei](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/shaowei-lin).
